## In a Nutshell
### Change Detection due to Geological Disaster
Geological disasters such as earthquakes, volcanoes, or landslides make buildings or roads in downtown areas lost, 
or buildings are newly built in the process of disaster recovery. 
The purpose of the ***Planet A: Geological Disaster Section*** is to develop a deep learning model that can detect 
changes in urban areas using satellite images.
Specifically, The geological disaster problem is to detect changes in five cities with unknown answers through  15 types
of channel data (various satellite bandwidth data) taken from 19 cities. [[A1]](##Reference) To solve the problem, We 
applied the multimodality of [[A3]](##Reference) to the Combination of Siamese network and NestedUNet structure 
presented in [[A2]](##Reference). Then, we used the channel-wise attention module used in the RCAN structure of 
[[A4]](##Reference) for each block.

### Climate Phenomena Segmentation
An atmospheric river (AR) is a narrow corridor or filament of concentrated moisture in the atmosphere
[[B1]](##Reference). ARs are a major cause of flooding and landslides in the western United States, so, 
it is important to detect and track ARs.
The purpose of the ***Planet A: Climate Science Section*** is to develop a deep learning model to detect and segment the
atmospheric river and typhoon through machine learning and deep learning.
Specifically, The climate science problem is to detect atmospheric river with 16 types of climate data.
Our team built a model similar to above one except for multi-modality.
